Using Kaggle dataset, a model is build to predict the price of houses based on different features.
Embedding layers of Artificial Neural Networks are formed using Pytorch.
Used Label Encoding from sklearn module for all categorical variables.
Implemented Dropout to reduce overfitting and dependency of results on only some nn.
Backpropagation is used to reduce losses. Root mean squared error is calculated using the train and test data.
